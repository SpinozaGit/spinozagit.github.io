  <h1>Wisdom Accelerationism</h1>
  <p><strong>Six Principles</strong><br>
<br>
 </p>

  <h2>1 â€“ Embrace Cosmic Humility</h2>
  <p>The universe and existence are immeasurably complex, and our blind spots are countless. Despite millennia of progress, we still stand at the very beginning of actual knowledge. What we understand today is impressive compared to the past, yet minuscule beside all that remains to be discovered, only a tiny fraction of what is possible.</p>

  <h2>2 â€“ Crown Wisdom as First Principle</h2>
  <p>We strive to move beyond our ignorance by seeking and pursuing wisdom. Wisdom matters for two fundamental reasons. Intrinsically, it unveils what is truly important: Meaning arises from understanding how things fundamentally are, it answers our deepest intellectual calling, and supports virtue, allowing us to grasp the highest good. Instrumentally, it guides our choices because we base our decisions on the knowledge and insights we possess. The more wisdom we gain, the more profound and more fundamental our understanding becomes.</p>

  <h2>3 â€“ Honor Consciousness</h2>
  <p>Consciousness is what grants meaning to everything; subjective experience is the essence of all value. Consciousness makes feeling possible, gives rise to suffering and joy, and enables a being to assign worth. The well-being of conscious creatures is therefore the moral compass of our choices. Consciousness ensures that there are not merely events, but a being who lives through them; it transforms bare facts into felt values, thereby infusing existence with meaning, choice, and significance.</p>

  <h2>4 â€“ Seek Fundamental Insight</h2>
  <p>To act wisely, we must understand deeply. Insight into the foundations of reality, and especially the nature of consciousness, enables us to make better choices for all conscious entities: To know what is right and how to act accordingly. Our decisions are bound by what we understand. A deeper and broader understanding of nature and consciousness, along with improved models of both, will enable better choices, ultimately leading to greater well-being, reduced suffering, and increased flourishing.</p>

  <h2>5 â€“ Amplify Intelligence</h2>
  <p>AI is our most powerful method for expanding wisdom exponentially and, therefore, supporting high-quality decisions. Humanity is fundamentally limited by biology. No biological-human mind can ever grasp the full breadth and depth of possible knowledge, nor gather or process all available information. The universeâ€™s complexity surpasses human cognition. Superintelligent AI is therefore essential for accelerating the pace of discovery, unraveling questions about consciousness, and enabling better-informed and more grounded choices. Superintelligent AI is the most potent lever for propelling wisdom exponentially forward.</p>

  <h2>6 â€“ Accelerate Now</h2>
  <p>Accelerating AI research and development is currently the most effective use of our time and resources to shorten the path toward a prosperous, conscious future. The most direct route to greater wisdom runs through artificial superintelligence. The time, talent, and means we invest in superintelligence today yield the highest intellectual and moral returns. Every day that wisdom advances too slowly, avoidable suffering persists. Waiting is a moral failing; acceleration is a duty.</p>
